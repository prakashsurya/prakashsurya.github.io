 * The table of contents will be displayed immediately after an "h1"
 * tag, and since that "h1" will already have a "bottom" margin, using
 * the default top margin of the "ul" provides too much whitespace
 * between the "h1" title for the page, and the table of contents
 * section. We fix the problem by removing this addition top margin of
 * the "ul" element, and realy solely on the margin of the "h1" title.

 * Hugo will generate HTML for the table of contents that looks like the
 * following:
 *
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>
 *         <ul>
 *           <li>Section 1</li>
 *           <li>Section 2</li>
 *           ...
 *         </ul>
 *       </li>
 *     </ul>
 *
 * As a result, the "outer li" element will produce a single "bullet
 * point" that's in addtion to the point for each individual section.
 * This "outer li" element doesn't correspond to any table of content
 * section, and just looks wrong when rendered. For example, the above
 * would be rendered like so:
 *
 *     - - Section 1
 *       - Section 2
 *       ...
 *
 * These two statements are intended to remove that extraneous point
 * produced by the "outer li" element, but keep the points produced by
 * each of the "inner li" elements.
 *
 * We have to override the "content" property, since that's set by
 * "hack.css", and we need to override that setting.
