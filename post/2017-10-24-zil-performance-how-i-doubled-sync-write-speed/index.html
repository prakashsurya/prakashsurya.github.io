# 1 &amp;ndash; What is the ZIL?

---

# What is the ZIL?

 - ZIL: Acronym for (Z)FS (I)ntent (L)og

    - Logs synchronous operations to disk, before `spa_sync()`

    - What constitutes a &#34;synchronous operation&#34;?

       - most _modifying_ ZPL operations:

          - e.g. `zfs_create`, `zfs_unlink`, `zfs_write` (some), etc.

       - doesn&#39;t include non-modifying ZPL operations:

          - e.g. `zfs_read`, `zfs_seek`, etc.

---

# When is the ZIL used?

 - Always&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;

    - ZPL operations (`itx`&#39;s) logged via in-memory lists

    - lists of in-memory `itx`&#39;s written to disk via `zil_commit()`

    - `zil_commit()` called for:

       - _any_ sync write

       - other sync operations (e.g. create, unlink), **and** `sync=always`

       - _some_ reads (`sync=always` or `FRSYNC` set)

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;Except when dataset configured with: `sync=disabled`]

???

- Caveat: None of this applies if dataset configured with: `sync=disabled`

  - in-memory `itx`&#39;s aren&#39;t created

  - `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t do writes to disk

---

# What is the SLOG?

 - SLOG: Acronym for (S)eperate (LOG) Device

    - An SLOG is not necessary

    - An SLOG can be used to improve latency of ZIL writes

 - Conceptually, SLOG is different than the ZIL

 - ZIL is used, even if no SLOG attached

???

- _An SLOG is not necessary_

   - By default (no SLOG), ZIL will write to main pool VDEVs

- _An SLOG can be used to improve latency of ZIL writes_

   - When attached, ZIL writes to SLOG instead of main pool

- _Conceptually, SLOG is different than the ZIL_

   - Difference between SLOG and ZIL, similar difference of DMU and VDEV

   - ZIL is mechanism for writing, SLOG is device written to

---

# Why does the ZIL exist?

 - Writes in ZFS are &#34;write-back&#34;

 - Without the ZIL, sync operations inherit latency of `spa_sync()`&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;

    - `spa_sync()` can take tens of seconds (or more) to complete

 - Further, with the ZIL, write amplification can be mitigated

 - ZIL is essentially a performance optimization

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;All operations inherit this latency, but only sync operations wait for completion]
???

- _Writes in ZFS are &#34;write-back&#34;_

   - Data is first written and stored in-memory, in DMU layer...

   - At some later point, data for whole pool written to disk via `spa_sync()`.

- _Without ZIL, all sync operations inherit latency of `spa_sync()`_

   - We don&#39;t want each sync operation to take this log

- _Further, with the ZIL, write amplification can be mitigated_

   - A single ZPL operation, can cause many writes to occur

     - e.g. 1 block write to a file causes additional writes to update
       indirect blocks

   - ZIL allows operation to &#34;complete&#34; with minimal data written

- _ZIL is essentially a performance optimization_

  - Strictly speaking, correctness could be achieved without it...

       - e.g. all sync ops could just wait for `spa_sync()` to complete

    - But practically speaking, it&#39;s necessary...

       - Performance would be unreasonably bad without it

---

# ZIL On-Disk Format

 - Each dataset has it&#39;s own unique ZIL on-disk

 - ZIL stored on-disk as a singly linked list of ZIL blocks (`lwb`&#39;s)

&lt;hr style=&#34;visibility:hidden;&#34; /&gt;

.center[![](zil-on-disk-format.svg)]

???

- _ZIL stored on-disk as a singly linked list of ZIL blocks (`lwb`&#39;s)_

   - each ZIL block contains a pointer to the &#34;next&#34; ZIL block

---

# 2 &amp;ndash; How is the ZIL used?

---

# How is the ZIL used?

 - ZPL will generally interact with the ZIL in two phases:

    1. Log the operation(s) &amp;mdash; `zil_itx_assign`

    2. Commit the operation(s) &amp;mdash; `zil_commit`

???

1. _Log the operation(s)_

   - Tells the ZIL the operation occurred

   - Only called when _new_ ZPL operations occur

2. _Commit the operation(s)_

   - Causes the ZIL to write log record of operation to disk

   - Only called if sync write, or `sync=always`

---

# Example: `zfs_write`

 - `zfs_write` &amp;rarr; `zfs_log_write`

 - `zfs_log_write`

    &amp;rarr; `zil_itx_create`

    &amp;rarr; `zil_itx_assign`

 - `zfs_write` &amp;rarr; `zil_commit`

 - Most ZPL operations have a corresponding `zfs_log_*` function

    - `zfs_log_create`
    - `zfs_log_remove`
    - `zfs_log_link`
    - `zfs_log_symlink`
    - `zfs_log_truncate`
    - `zfs_log_setattr`
    - ...

???

- These `zil_itx_*` functions register the write operation with the ZIL

- Later, `zfs_write` will call `zil_commit` (if it&#39;s a sync write)

   - This causes ZIL to write previously generated write `itx` to disk

- All `zfs_log_*` functions similarly call `zil_itx_{create,assign}`

---

# Example: `zfs_fsync`

 - `zfs_fsync` &amp;rarr; `zil_commit`

    - no _new_ operations to log... no `zfs_log_fysnc` function

???

- `zfs_fsync` doesn&#39;t have a &#34;log&#34; function

   - `fsync` doesn&#39;t create any new modifications...

   - instead, it only ensures prior modifying operations complete.

   - as a result, there isn&#39;t a `zfs_log_fsync` function

---

# Contract between ZIL and ZPL.

 - Parameters to `zil_commit`: ZIL pointer, object number

    - These uniquely identify an object whose data is to be committed

 - When `zil_commit` returns:

    - Operations _relevant_ to the object specified, will be _persistent_
      on disk

    - relevant &amp;ndash; all operations that would modify that object

    - persistent &amp;ndash; Log block(s) written (completed) &amp;rarr; disk flushed

 - Interface of `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t specify _which_ operation(s) to commit

???

# Contract between ZIL and ZPL.

- _relevant &amp;ndash; all operations that would modify that object_

   - &#34;sync&#34; and &#34;async&#34;...

   - e.g. &#34;async&#34; writes written along with &#34;sync&#34; writes

- _persistent &amp;ndash; Log block(s) written (completed) &amp;rarr; disk flushed_

   - All &#34;prior/dependent&#34; log blocks written and completed

   - We can&#39;t issue the flush before the write completes...

      - or else, disk flush may not contain log block&#39;s contents.

         - concurrent write &#43; flush can be reordered

      - if flush doesn&#39;t contain log block(s), flush was meaningless

- _Interface of `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t specify _which_ operation(s) to commit_

   - `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t know which operation(s) the caller cares about...

      - thus, it must write all operations for the object

      - e.g. multiple threads writing to same object, but different offsets...

      - all offsets must be written before `zil_commit` returns

# 2 &amp;ndash; How does the ZIL work?

---

# How does the ZIL work?

 - In memory ZIL contains per-txg `itxg_t` structures

 - Each `itxg_t` contains:

    - A single list of sync operations (for all objects)

    - Object specific lists of async operations

???

- _In memory ZIL contains per-txg `itxg_t` structures_

   - An `itxg_t` exists for each DMU TXG not yet synced to disk

   - Each `itx` is specific to a TXG...

      - assigned to corresponding `itxg_t` for that TXG

---

# Example: itx lists

&lt;br /&gt;

![](itx-lists.svg)

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

???

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. find all relavant `itx`&#39;s, move them to the &#34;commit list&#34;

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-01.svg)

???

 - Same itx lists as before... plus the commit list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-02.svg)

???

- Calling `zil_commit` for object &#34;B&#34;

- First step is to move object B&#39;s async `itx`&#39;s to the sync list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-03.svg)

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-04.svg)

???

- Now we move the entire sync list to the commit list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-05.svg)

???

- So, why do we move sync list `itx`&#39;s to the commit list?

   - So the thread that writes these `itx`&#39;s out to disk...

      - can work with a list that won&#39;t change due to concurrent activity

   - If there&#39;s concurrent ZPL operations occurring...

      - those operations may insert new `itx`&#39;s onto the sync list.

   - We create the &#34;commit list&#34; so the list of `itx`s to write out...

      - is isolated from this concurrent ZPL activity

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. ~~Move async itx&#39;s for object being commited, to the sync list~~

     2. Write all commit list `itx`&#39;s to disk

???

- We do this by iterating over the `itx`&#39;s in the commit list

- For each `itx`:

   1. If insufficient space in the currently &#34;open&#34; ZIL block:

      - Allocate a new (empty) ZIL block, issue write of old block

   2. Copy the `itx` into the &#34;open&#34; ZIL block

- Last, we issue last &#34;open&#34; ZIL block to disk

   - this also means, allocated another block...

   - to be the next &#34;open&#34; ZIL block

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-01.svg)

???

- Starting with the commit list from before...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-02.svg)

???

- Select the first `itx` in the list...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-03.svg)

???

- allocate our first ZIL block...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-04.svg)

???

- and copy the `itx` into the `lwb`&#39;s buffer.

- The `lwb` still hasn&#39;t been issued to disk yet...

   - it may be used for the next `itx`.

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-05.svg)

???

- Now we move on to the next `itx` in the list...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-06.svg)

???

- This `itx` doesn&#39;t fit in the currently &#34;open&#34; lwb

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-07.svg)

???

- so we must allocate a new `lwb`, and issue the &#34;open&#34; one to disk

- The newly allocated `lwb` becomes the new &#34;open&#34; lwb

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-08.svg)

???

- Now we can copy the `itx` into the new `lwb`

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-09.svg)

???

- Next, we move on to the last `itx` in the list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-10.svg)

???

- This fits in the currently &#34;open&#34; `lwb`, so it&#39;s copied into place

- At this point, the commit list is empty...

   - so we must issue the current `lwb` to disk.

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-11.svg)

???

- To do that, we must allocate a new `lwb`

- This new `lwb` will then be used for the next &#34;batch&#34; of `itx`&#39;s

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. ~~Move async itx&#39;s for object being commited, to the sync list~~

     2. ~~Write all commit list `itx`&#39;s to disk~~

     3. Wait for all ZIL block writes to complete

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-3-01.svg)

???

- The `lwb`&#39;s can complete in any order...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-3-02.svg)

???

- here, &#34;lwb 2&#34; completes first...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-3-03.svg)

???

- and then &#34;lwb 1&#34;.

- At this point, all `lwb`&#39;s have been written and writes have completed.

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. ~~Move async itx&#39;s for object being commited, to the sync list~~

     2. ~~Write all commit list `itx`&#39;s to disk~~

     3. ~~Wait for all ZIL block writes to complete~~

     4. Flush VDEVs and notify waiting threads

# 2 &amp;ndash; ZIL Block Sizing &#43; Performance

---

# ZIL Block Sizing &#43; Performance

 - ZIL blocks must be &#34;pre-allocated&#34;, due to on-disk format

    - Block size chosen at time of allocation

 - Allocated block size can dramatically impact performance:

    - &#34;too big&#34; &amp;ndash; wasted space

    - &#34;too small&#34; &amp;ndash; too many (small) IOPs issued to disk

    - &#34;just right&#34; &amp;ndash; large IOPs filled with `itx`&#39;s

???

# ZIL Block Sizing &#43; Performance

- _ZIL blocks must be &#34;pre-allocated&#34;, due to on-disk format_

   - Each ZIL block contains pointer to next ZIL block on disk...

      - Thus, &#34;next&#34; block allocated when the &#34;current&#34; is issued to disk

- _Allocated block size can dramatically impact performance:_

   - Because blocks &#34;pre-allocated&#34;...

      - the size of &#34;next&#34; block is decided before number of `itx`&#39;s is known

- _&#34;too big&#34;_

   - Block only partially filled with `itx`&#39;s

   - Can result in small, but fast, SLOG filling to capacity

      - full SLOG can cause poor performance

- _&#34;too small&#34;_

   - Can cause disk saturation and poor performance

- _&#34;just right&#34;_

   - ZIL blocks fully utilized with `itx`&#39;s (no wasted SLOG space)

   - Fewer IOPs for same number of `itx`&#39;s

      - e.g. 15 8K writes using 1 128K lwb vs. 4 32K lwb&#39;s

---

class: middle, center

# 3 &amp;ndash; Problem

---

# Problem(s)

 1. `itx`&#39;s grouped and written in &#34;batches&#34;

    - The commit list constitutes a batch

    - Batch size proportional to sync workload on system

 2. Waiting threads only notified when _all_ ZIL blocks in batch complete

 3. Only a single batch processed at a time

---

# Example Batch

&lt;br /&gt;

![](problem-01.svg)

???

- Same batch from prior slides...

---

# Example &#34;itx S1&#34;

&lt;br /&gt;

![](problem-02.svg)

???

- If a thread is waiting for &#34;itx S1&#34; to be persisted...

---

# Example &#34;itx S1&#34;

&lt;br /&gt;

![](problem-03.svg)

???

- it must actually wait for **all** `lwb`&#39;s to be persisted.

---

# Implications

 1. `zil_commit` latency proportional to system workload, _not_ disk latency

 2. Disk &#34;anomalies&#34; &amp;rarr; larger batches &amp;rarr; increased `zil_commit` latency

 3. New calls to `zil_commit` wait for &#34;current&#34; batch, _and_ &#34;next&#34; batch

???

1. _`zil_commit` latency_

   - Fast SLOG may not compensate for large workload

2. _Disk &#34;anomalies&#34;_

   - e.g. Temporary network delays when using SAN storage

3. _New calls to `zil_commit`_

   - Average `zil_commit` latency equal to latency of 1.5 batches

---

class: middle, center

# 3 &amp;ndash; Solution

---

# Solution

 - Remove concept of &#34;batches&#34;:

    1. Allow `zil_commit` to issue new ZIL block writes immediately

    2. Notify threads immediately when _dependent_ `itx`&#39;s on disk

???

1. _Allow `zil_commit` to issue new ZIL block writes immediately_

   - In contrast to waiting for &#34;current&#34; batch to complete

2. _Notify threads immediately when dependent `itx`&#39;s on disk_

   - In contrast to waiting for **all** `itx`&#39;s on disk (dependent or not)

---

# Example &#34;Batch&#34;

&lt;br /&gt;

![](solution-01.svg)

???

- Same example as before

---

# Example &#34;itx S1&#34;

&lt;br /&gt;

![](solution-02.svg)

???

- Same thread waiting for &#34;itx S1&#34; to be persisted...

---

# Example &#34;itx S1&#34;

&lt;br /&gt;

![](solution-03.svg)

???

- But, now it must wait for _only_ &#34;lwb 1&#34; to complete

   - Previously, would have also waited for &#34;lwb 2&#34;

- Might not seem significant for a small example with 2 `lwb`&#39;s...

   - But it can be significant with 100&#39;s of `lwb`&#39;s on a real system

# 4 &amp;ndash; Changes to VDEV Flush

---

# Details

 - A ZIL block is not &#34;persistent&#34; until the VDEV is flushed

 - Prior mechanics:

    - Single VDEV flush for each VDEV, after batch completes

    - 1 flush per many lwb&#39;s

 - New mechanics:

    - VDEV flush issued after each ZIL block written

    - 1 flush per 1 lwb

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](flush-sequence-before.svg)]

???

- 2 `lwb`&#39;s are written to VDEV 1...

   - but only a single flush is issued to it.

- Additionally, all flushes are issued at the very end.

---

# Example: After

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](flush-sequence-after.svg)]

???

- The same 2 `lwb`&#39;s are written to VDEV 1...

   - but 2 flushes are issued to it.

- Additionally, the flushes are issued immediately after corresponding
  &#34;lwb done&#34;.

---

class: middle, center

# 4 &amp;ndash; Changes to ZIL Block ZIO Tree

---

# Details

 - ZIL blocks issued to disk using ZIOs

 - Prior mechanics:

    - &#34;root&#34; ZIO created for each batch

       - &#34;write&#34; ZIOs, for all `lwb`&#39;s in batch, are children of root ZIO

    - &#34;flush&#34; ZIOs issued separately after root ZIO completes

 - New mechanics:

    - &#34;root&#34; ZIO created for each lwb

       - &#34;write&#34; and &#34;flush&#34; ZIOs are child of root ZIO

    - &#34;next&#34; lwb root ZIO become parent of &#34;current&#34; lwb root ZIO

???

- _ZIL blocks issued to disk using ZIOs_

   - ZIOs represented as directed acyclic graph (DAG)

   - Parent ZIOs cannot complete until all children complete

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](zio-tree-before-01.svg)]

???

- First, the root ZIO for the batch is generated

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](zio-tree-before-02.svg)]

???

- Then the `lwb` ZIOs are created as children

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](zio-tree-before-03.svg)]

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](zio-tree-before-04.svg)]

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](zio-tree-before-05.svg)]

???

- After all `lwb` ZIOs complete...

- the root ZIO for the VDEV flush commands is generated

---

# Example: Before

&lt;br /&gt;

.center[![](zio-tree-before-06.svg)]

???

- And we&#39;d issue a flush to each VDEV written to

---

- Once all VDEV flushes complete...

- we&#39;re done, and any waiting threads would be notified

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-01.svg)

???

- The ZIO tree is dramatically different after my changes...

- Now, we create a root ZIO similar to before...

- But this root ZIO is specific to an `lwb`, as will become clear

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-02.svg)

???

- Next, we create another ZIO for the &#34;write&#34; of the `lwb`

- This ZIO contains the actual data and `itx`&#39;s to be persisted

- Also, it&#39;s a child of the `lwb`&#39;s root ZIO

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-03.svg)

???

- After that &#34;write&#34; ZIO **completes**, the flush ZIO is issued

- The flush ZIO is also a child of the `lwb` root ZIO

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-04.svg)

???

# Example: After

- If another `lwb` is to be written...

- it&#39;ll also have a root ZIO of its own

- Further, it&#39;ll have the prior `lwb`&#39;s root ZIO as a child

   - we do this so that the root ZIO for &#34;lwb 2&#34; can&#39;t complete...

   - until &#34;lwb 1&#34; completes.

   - The importance of the order of these ZIO completions...

   - will hopefully become more clear later.

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-05.svg)

???

- Next, we create the `lwb` write ZIO just like before

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-06.svg)

???

- To make things more interesting...

   - let&#39;s say the next `lwb` is issued before this `lwb`&#39;s &#34;write&#34; completes.

- In this case, the &#34;write&#34; for &#34;lwb 2&#34; will still be outstanding...

   - so the flush for that lwb will not have been issued...

   - but a new `lwb` can still be created and issued.

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-07.svg)

???

 - And this `lwb` will also have a child &#34;write&#34; ZIO

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-08.svg)

???

- It&#39;s even possible for the &#34;write&#34; of &#34;lwb 3&#34; to complete before...

   - the &#34;write&#34; of &#34;lwb 2&#34;

- If that occurs, the flush for &#34;lwb 3&#34; will get issued before...

   - the flush for &#34;lwb 2&#34;

- It&#39;s important to note...

   - even if the flush of &#34;lwb 3&#34; were to complete...

   - the root ZIO &#34;lwb 3&#34; can&#39;t complete...

   - becuase the root for &#34;lwb 2&#34; is still in progress.

   - This is enforced by the ZIO layer...

      - a &#34;parent&#34; ZIO can&#39;t complete until all children complete

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-09.svg)

???

- Now, lets say the &#34;write&#34; for &#34;lwb 2&#34; completes...

   - so the flush for &#34;lwb 2&#34; is issued.

- Since &#34;lwb 3&#34; may have already completed it&#39;s write and flush...

   - it&#39;s possible for &#34;lwb 2&#34; and &#34;lwb 3&#34; to complete &#34;simultaneously&#34;

---

# Example: After

![:scale 100%](zio-tree-after-10.svg)

???

 - This pattern will continue as long as there&#39;s `lwb`&#39;s to issue to disk

---

# Example: After

![:scale 100%](zio-tree-after-11.svg)

---

# Example: After

![:scale 100%](zio-tree-after-12.svg)

???

- As `lwb` root ZIOs complete...

   - they&#39;ll simply be removed from the &#34;tail&#34; of the tree

- Here, &#34;lwb 1&#34; has been removed

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-13.svg)

???

- Now &#34;lwb 2&#34;

---

# Example: After

![](zio-tree-after-14.svg)

???

- And &#34;lwb 3&#34;... etc.

# 4 &amp;ndash; Changes to Waiter Notification

---

# Details: Before

 - 2 condition variables (CV), for &#34;current&#34; and &#34;next&#34; batch

 - Threads that called `zil_commit`:

    - Assigned to &#34;next batch&#34;, wait on next batch&#39;s CV

 - When &#34;current&#34; batch completes

    1. All threads waiting on &#34;current&#34; signalled, they&#39;d return

    2. One thread waiting on &#34;next&#34; signalled, becomes &#34;writer&#34;

    3. &#34;next&#34; and &#34;current&#34; CV swapped

 - Ultimately, these two CVs are the source of original problem

---

# Example: Before

.center[![](waiter-sequence-before-01.svg)]

???

- Here&#39;s a possible sequence of events...

- But don&#39;t try and understand it all right now

---

# Example: Before

.center[![](waiter-sequence-before-02.svg)]

???

- Instead, I want to hightlight how/when processes become &#34;done&#34;

- Specifically, writer threads must stop writing...

   - in order to notifiy and wake up any waiting threads

- Further, this notification only occurs after an entire batch completes

---

# Details: After

 - Each `lwb` has a list of CVs

 - Each time a process calls `zil_commit`:

    - A new CV is allocated for this specific process to wait on

    - This CV is attached to the `lwb` that will persist the process&#39;s
      data&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;

 - When an `lwb`&#39;s ZIO completes, each CV in the `lwb`&#39;s list is signalled

 - This allows processes to be signalled while `lwb`&#39;s are being written

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;How we determine which `lwb` does this isn&#39;t covered.]

---

# Example: After

.center[![](waiter-sequence-after-01.svg)]

???

- Here&#39;s another sequence of events...

- Like before, there&#39;s a lot to take in...

- so don&#39;t try and understand it all

---

# Example: After

.center[![](waiter-sequence-after-02.svg)]

???

- Instead, I want to highlight how/when processes become &#34;done&#34;

- In this &#34;new world&#34;, processes are signalled as done from the &#34;ZIO
  done&#34; callback

- Further, we can see that they&#39;re signalled while `lwb`&#39;s are being
  written

- Thus, there&#39;s no &#34;start&#34;/&#34;stop&#34; sort of behavior like previously...

   - Where we&#39;d have to stop writing, in order to signal waiters

- Now the waiter&#39;s are notified &#34;async&#34; from the context of the writer...

   - immediately from the ZIO done callback for that process&#39;s `lwb`

# 5 &amp;ndash; Performance testing and results.

---

# Details

 - Two `fio` workloads used to drive a sync write workload

    1. `fio` was trying to perform sync writes as fast as it could

    2. `fio` was trying to perform 64 sync writes per second

 - IOPs and latency measured with and without my changes

    - Other metrics also observed (`iostat`, flamegraphs, lwb info, etc.)

 - 1, 2, 4, and 8 disk zpools; tested both SSD and HDD

 - Full details can be found [here][perf-results]
