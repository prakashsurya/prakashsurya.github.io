# 1 &amp;ndash; What is the ZIL?

---

# What is the ZIL?

 - ZIL: Acronym for (Z)FS (I)ntent (L)og

    - Logs synchronous operations to disk, before `spa_sync()`

    - What operations get logged?

       - `zfs_create`, `zfs_remove`, `zfs_write`, etc.

       - Doesn&#39;t include non-modifying ZPL operations:

          - `zfs_read`, `zfs_seek`, etc.

    - What gets logged?

       - The fact that a logical operation is occuring is logged

          - `zfs_remove` &amp;rarr; directory object ID &#43; name only

       - Not logging which blocks will change due to logical operation

---

# When is the ZIL used?

 - Always&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;

    - ZPL operations (`itx`&#39;s) logged via in-memory lists

    - lists of in-memory `itx`&#39;s written to disk via `zil_commit()`

    - `zil_commit()` called for:

       - _any_ sync write&lt;sup&gt;\**&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;Except when dataset configured with: `sync=disabled`.
          &lt;sup&gt;\**&lt;/sup&gt;Except when dataset configured with: `sync=always`.]

---

# What is the SLOG?

 - SLOG: Acronym for (S)eperate (LOG) Device

    - An SLOG is not necessary

       - By default (no SLOG), ZIL will write to main pool VDEVs

    - An SLOG can be used to improve latency of ZIL writes

       - When attached, ZIL writes to SLOG instead of main pool&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;

 - Conceptually, SLOG is different than the ZIL

   - ZIL is mechanism for writing, SLOG is device written to

 - ZIL is used, even if no SLOG attached

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;For some operations; see code for details.]

---

# Why does the ZIL exist?

 - Writes in ZFS are &#34;write-back&#34;

    - Data is first written and stored in-memory, in DMU layer

    - Later, data for whole pool written to disk via `spa_sync()`

 - Without the ZIL, sync operations could wait for `spa_sync()`

    - `spa_sync()` can take tens of seconds (or more) to complete

 - Further, with the ZIL, write amplification can be mitigated

    - A single ZPL operation can cause many writes to occur

    - ZIL allows operation to &#34;complete&#34; with minimal data written

 - ZIL needed to provide &#34;fast&#34; synchronous semantics to applications

    - Correctness could be acheived without it, but would be &#34;too slow&#34;

---

# ZIL On-Disk Format

 - Each dataset has it&#39;s own unique ZIL on-disk

 - ZIL stored on-disk as a singly linked list of ZIL blocks (`lwb`&#39;s)

# 2 &amp;ndash; How is the ZIL used?

---

# How is the ZIL used?

 - ZPL will generally interact with the ZIL in two phases:

    1. Log the operation(s) &amp;mdash; `zil_itx_assign`

        - Tells the ZIL an operation is occuring

    2. Commit the operation(s) &amp;mdash; `zil_commit`

        - Causes the ZIL to write log record of operation to disk

---

# Example: `zfs_write`

 - `zfs_write` &amp;rarr; `zfs_log_write`

 - `zfs_log_write`

    &amp;rarr; `zil_itx_create`

    &amp;rarr; `zil_itx_assign`

 - `zfs_write` &amp;rarr; `zil_commit`

 - Most ZPL operations have a corresponding `zfs_log_*` function

    - `zfs_log_create`
    - `zfs_log_remove`
    - `zfs_log_link`
    - `zfs_log_symlink`
    - `zfs_log_truncate`
    - `zfs_log_setattr`
    - ...

???

- These `zil_itx_*` functions register the write operation with the ZIL

- Later, `zfs_write` will call `zil_commit` (if it&#39;s a sync write)

   - This causes ZIL to write previously generated write `itx` to disk

- All `zfs_log_*` functions similarly call `zil_itx_{create,assign}`

---

# Example: `zfs_fsync`

 - `zfs_fsync` &amp;rarr; `zil_commit`

   - `fsync` doesn&#39;t create any new modifications

   - only writes previous `itx`&#39;s to disk

      - thus, no `zfs_log_fsync` function

---

# Contract between ZIL and ZPL.

 - Parameters to `zil_commit`: ZIL pointer, object number

    - These uniquely identify an object whose data is to be committed

 - When `zil_commit` returns:

    - Operations _relevant_ to the object specified, will be _persistent_
      on disk

    - relevant &amp;ndash; all operations that would modify that object

    - persistent &amp;ndash; Log block(s) written (completed) &amp;rarr; disk flushed

 - Interface of `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t specify _which_ operation(s) to commit

???

# Contract between ZIL and ZPL.

- _relevant &amp;ndash; all operations that would modify that object_

   - &#34;sync&#34; and &#34;async&#34;...

   - e.g. &#34;async&#34; writes written along with &#34;sync&#34; writes

- _persistent &amp;ndash; Log block(s) written (completed) &amp;rarr; disk flushed_

   - All &#34;prior/dependent&#34; log blocks written and completed

   - We can&#39;t issue the flush before the write completes...

      - or else, disk flush may not contain log block&#39;s contents.

         - concurrent write &#43; flush can be reordered

      - if flush doesn&#39;t contain log block(s), flush was meaningless

- _Interface of `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t specify _which_ operation(s) to commit_

   - `zil_commit` doesn&#39;t know which operation(s) the caller cares about...

      - thus, it must write all operations for the object

      - e.g. multiple threads writing to same object, but different offsets...

      - all offsets must be written before `zil_commit` returns

# 2 &amp;ndash; How does the ZIL work?

---

# How does the ZIL work?

 - In memory ZIL contains per-txg `itxg_t` structures

 - Each `itxg_t` contains:

    - A single list of sync operations (for all objects)

    - Object specific lists of async operations

???

- _In memory ZIL contains per-txg `itxg_t` structures_

   - An `itxg_t` exists for each DMU TXG not yet synced to disk

   - Each `itx` is specific to a TXG...

      - assigned to corresponding `itxg_t` for that TXG

---

# Example: itx lists

&lt;br /&gt;

![](itx-lists.svg)

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

???

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. find all relevant `itx`&#39;s, move them to the &#34;commit list&#34;

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-01.svg)

???

 - Same itx lists as before... plus the commit list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-02.svg)

???

- Calling `zil_commit` for object &#34;B&#34;

- First step is to move object B&#39;s async `itx`&#39;s to the sync list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-03.svg)

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-04.svg)

???

- Now we move the entire sync list to the commit list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-1-05.svg)

???

- We create the &#34;commit list&#34; so the list of `itx`s to write out...

   - is isolated from this concurrent ZPL activity

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. ~~Move async itx&#39;s for object being commited, to the sync list~~

     2. Write all commit list `itx`&#39;s to disk

???

- We do this by iterating over the `itx`&#39;s in the commit list

- For each `itx`:

   1. If insufficient space in the currently &#34;open&#34; ZIL block:

      - Allocate a new (empty) ZIL block, issue write of old block

   2. Copy the `itx` into the &#34;open&#34; ZIL block

- Last, we issue last &#34;open&#34; ZIL block to disk

   - this also means, allocated another block...

   - to be the next &#34;open&#34; ZIL block

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-03.svg)

???

- Starting with a ZIL header and `lwb` block already allocated...

- Select the first `itx` in the list...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-04.svg)

???

- and copy the `itx` into the `lwb`&#39;s buffer.

- The `lwb` still hasn&#39;t been issued to disk yet...

   - it may be used for the next `itx`.

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-05.svg)

???

- Now we move on to the next `itx` in the list...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-06.svg)

???

- This `itx` doesn&#39;t fit in the currently &#34;open&#34; lwb

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-07.svg)

???

- so we must allocate a new `lwb`, and issue the &#34;open&#34; one to disk

- The newly allocated `lwb` becomes the new &#34;open&#34; lwb

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-08.svg)

???

- Now we can copy the `itx` into the new `lwb`

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-09.svg)

???

- Next, we move on to the last `itx` in the list

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-10.svg)

???

- This fits in the currently &#34;open&#34; `lwb`, so it&#39;s copied into place

- At this point, the commit list is empty...

   - so we must issue the current `lwb` to disk.

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-2-11.svg)

???

- To do that, we must allocate a new `lwb`

- This new `lwb` will then be used for the next &#34;batch&#34; of `itx`&#39;s

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. ~~Move async itx&#39;s for object being commited, to the sync list~~

     2. ~~Write all commit list `itx`&#39;s to disk~~

     3. Wait for all ZIL block writes to complete

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-3-01.svg)

???

- The `lwb`&#39;s can complete in any order...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-3-02.svg)

???

- here, &#34;lwb 2&#34; completes first...

---

# Example: `zil_commit` Object B

&lt;br /&gt;

![](zil-commit-3-03.svg)

???

- and then &#34;lwb 1&#34;.

- At this point, all `lwb`&#39;s have been written and writes have completed.

---

# How are itx&#39;s written to disk?

 - `zil_commit` handles the process of writing `itx_t`&#39;s to disk:

     1. ~~Move async itx&#39;s for object being commited, to the sync list~~

     2. ~~Write all commit list `itx`&#39;s to disk~~

     3. ~~Wait for all ZIL block writes to complete~~

     4. Flush VDEVs

# 3 &amp;ndash; Problem

---

# Problem

 1. `itx`&#39;s grouped and written in &#34;batches&#34;

    - The commit list constitutes a batch

    - Batch size proportional to sync workload on system

 2. Waiting threads only notified when _all_ ZIL blocks in batch complete

 3. Only a single batch processed at a time

---

# Problem

![](problem.svg)

 - Time spent servicing `lwb`&#39;s for each disk

 - Color indicates order waiting threads notified

---

# Implications

 1. `zil_commit` latency proportional to system workload, _not_ disk latency

   - Fast SLOG may not compensate for large workload

 2. Disk &#34;anomalies&#34; &amp;rarr; larger batches &amp;rarr; increased `zil_commit` latency

   - e.g. temporary network delays when using network storage

 3. New calls to `zil_commit` wait for &#34;current&#34; batch, _and_ &#34;next&#34; batch

   - Average `zil_commit` latency equal to latency of 1.5 batches

---

class: middle, center

# 3 &amp;ndash; Solution

---

# Solution

 - Remove concept of &#34;batches&#34;:

    1. Allow `zil_commit` to issue new ZIL block writes immediately

       - In contrast to waiting for the current batch to complete

    2. Notify threads immediately when _dependent_ `lwb`&#39;s on disk

       - In contrast to waiting for _all_ `lwb`&#39;s on disk

???

1. _Allow `zil_commit` to issue new ZIL block writes immediately_


2. _Notify threads immediately when dependent `itx`&#39;s on disk_

   - In contrast to waiting for **all** `itx`&#39;s on disk (dependent or not)

# 4 &amp;ndash; Details on the Changes I Made

---

background-image: url(changes-before-01.svg)
background-size: 65%

## Before

???

- Bulk of changes I made revolves around the following 3 things:

   1. how `lwb`&#39;s are issued to disk

   2. how flush commands are sent to the disks

   3. how waiting threads are notified

- Previously, this was a mostly a sequential 3 step process...

---

background-image: url(changes-before-02.svg)
background-size: 65%

## Before

???

- Step 1 would consist of creating the `lwb`&#39;s...

   - issuing these to disk...

   - and then waiting for the IO for all the `lwb`&#39;s to complete.

---

background-image: url(changes-before-03.svg)
background-size: 65%

## Before

???

- Once that Step 1 completes...

   - Step 2 would consist of issuing the flush commands to each VDEV...

   - and then waiting for all of them to complete.

---

background-image: url(changes-before-04.svg)
background-size: 65%

## Before

???

- And then, _finally_, after all flushes have completed...

   - the ZIL&#39;s CV is signalled to notify any waiting threads...

   - letting them know their data is safe on disk.

- All 3 of these steps would consist of a single batch.

---

background-image: url(changes-before-05.svg)
background-size: 65%

## Before

???

- And, after one batch completes...

   - another would start up again.

---

background-image: url(changes-before-06.svg)
background-size: 65%

## Before

???

- And another.

- This would repeat as long as...

   - there was a continuous stream of incoming sync operations to process.

---

background-image: url(changes-after-01.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- Now the process is entirely different...

   - and heavily leaverages the ZIO infrastructure

- Each `lwb` will have a root ZIO, which will eventually have 2 children:

   1. A &#34;write&#34; ZIO containing the `itx` data to be written

   2. A &#34;flush&#34; ZIO that will be issued after the &#34;write&#34; ZIO completes

- Since these are children, the `lwb`&#39;s &#34;root&#34; ZIO...

   - cannot complete until both the &#34;write&#34; and the &#34;flush&#34; complete

   - This is enforced by the ZIO parent-child dependency semantics

- Further, the &#34;root&#34; ZIO of each &#34;previous&#34; `lwb`...

   - will be a &#34;child&#34; of the &#34;root&#34; ZIO for the &#34;next&#34; `lwb`

   - This ensures the `lwb`&#39;s completes in correct order...

      - again, leveraging ZIO dependencies to acheive this ordering

- Additionally, each `lwb` maintains a list of CVs...

   - Each CV on this list maps to a waiting thread

   - When the &#34;root&#34; ZIO for the `lwb` completes...

      - each CV in this list is signalled...

      - which notifies the waiting thread that it&#39;s data is safe on disk

- Let&#39;s walk through an example of what this looks like...

---

background-image: url(changes-after-02.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- First, the &#34;root&#34; ZIO for the `lwb` is created...

---

background-image: url(changes-after-03.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- And then the &#34;write&#34; ZIO is issued...

---

background-image: url(changes-after-04.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- When that &#34;write&#34; ZIO completes, the flush will immediately be issued

---

background-image: url(changes-after-05.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- Then, when the &#34;flush&#34; ZIO completes...

- that&#39;ll allow the &#34;root&#34; ZIO for this specific `lwb` to complete...

- at which point, each CV in the `lwb`&#39;s list of CVs will be signalled

---

background-image: url(changes-after-06.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- The same process would occur of the next `lwb`...

---

background-image: url(changes-after-07.svg)
background-size: 85%

## After

???

- And the next.

- It&#39;s important to note...

   - the sequence of events doesn&#39;t have to occur in this order

- For example, it&#39;s possible for &#34;lwb 2&#34; to have issued it&#39;s...

   - &#34;write&#34; ZIO before the &#34;write&#34; of &#34;lwb 1&#34; completes.

- It can even complete before the &#34;write&#34; of &#34;lwb 1&#34;...

   - Same goes for the &#34;flush&#34; for &#34;lwb 2&#34;

- **But**, due to the ZIO dependency tree, the &#34;root&#34; ZIO for &#34;lwb 2&#34;...

   - cannot complete until the &#34;root&#34; for &#34;lwb 1&#34; completes.

- Thus, the CVs for &#34;lwb 2&#34; will never be signalled...

   - prior to &#34;lwb 1&#34; completing

- **So**, while this example might imply...

   - this process is still very sequential, just like before...

   - it doesn&#39;t have to be...

- Now, it&#39;s all driven by the incoming workload...

   - and disk completion events.

   - `lwb`&#39;s are created and issued whenever there&#39;s data to write...

   - and waiting threads are notified whenever those writes complete.

# New Tunable: `lwb` Timeout

.center[![:scale 90%](lwb-timeout.svg)]

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;\*&lt;/sup&gt;New tunable named: `zfs_commit_timeout_pct`]

???

- Prior to issuing an `lwb` to disk, it remains &#34;open&#34;...

   - such that we can continue to use this `lwb`...

   - for any future `itx`&#39;s that occur, and would fit in the `lwb`

- This is done to help fill `lwb` blocks with useful `itx`&#39;s

   - in an attempt to use as few `lwb`&#39;s as possible...

   - for as many `itx`&#39;s as possible.

- This is critical to maintain good performance...

   - with a continuous stream of incoming sync operations.

- But, if incoming sync operations stop...

   - we need to bound the amount of time this &#34;open&#34; lwb waits...

   - before it is issued to disk, partially filled.

- We determine the amount of time to wait...

   - by waiting a percentage of the last `lwb` write&#39;s latency.

- By default, wait 5% of the last `lwb` write&#39;s latency...

- If the &#34;open&#34; `lwb` isn&#39;t filled in that amount of time...

   - it will &#34;timeout&#34;, and be issued to disk partially filled.

# More Details

 - Two `fio` workloads were used:

    1. each thread submitting sync writes as fast as it could

    2. each thread submitting 64 sync writes per second

 - 1, 2, 4, and 8 disk zpools; both SSD and HDD

 - `fio` threads ranging from 1 to 1024; increasing in powers of 2

 - Full details can be found [here][perf-results]
