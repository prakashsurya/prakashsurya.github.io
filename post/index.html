    </h2>
    <p>Introduction As part of our effort to support Delphix in the Azure cloud environment, we&rsquo;re writing some automation to convert our .iso install media into a VHD image, leveraging Jenkins and Packer in the process.
Essentially, we want to use a Windows server as a Jenkins &ldquo;slave&rdquo;, and run Packer from within a Jenkins job that will run on that Windows system.
In order to do that, the Jenkins &ldquo;master&rdquo; needs to connect with the Windows system, such that it can configure the system to act as a Jenkins slave.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Introduction The OpenZFS Intent Log (ZIL) is used to ensure POSIX compliance of certain system calls (that modify the state of a ZFS dataset), and protect against data loss in the face of failure scenarios such as: an operating system crash, power loss, etc. Specifically, it&rsquo;s used as a performance optimization so that applications can be assured that their given system call, and any &ldquo;user data&rdquo; associated with it, will not be &ldquo;lost&rdquo;, without having to wait for an entire transaction group (TXG) to be synced out (which can take on the order of seconds, on a moderately loaded system).</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Introduction The zpool reguid command can be used to regenerate the GUID for an OpenZFS pool, which is useful when using device level copies to generate multiple pools all with the same contents.
Example using File VDEVs As a contrived example, lets create a zpool backed by a single file vdev:
# mkdir /tmp/tank1 # mkfile -n 256m /tmp/tank1/vdev # zpool create tank1 /tmp/tank1/vdev # zpool list tank1 NAME SIZE ALLOC FREE EXPANDSZ FRAG CAP DEDUP HEALTH ALTROOT tank1 240M 78K 240M - 1% 0% 1.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Preface In this post, I&rsquo;ll pick up from where I left off last time, and demonstrate one potential way to convert the installation ISO media generated in that post, into an AMI that can be used to create new VMs in the Amazon EC2 environment. It&rsquo;s important to note a couple things before we start:
 While I&rsquo;ll be generating an AMI based on OI Hipster, this process should be applicable to any Linux or FreeBSD based operating system as well (and quite possibly Windows too, but I don&rsquo;t know much about that platform).</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Preface This post is a write up of my notes for creating custom installation media for OpenIndiana Hipster, using a custom/patched version of illumos. It assumes that OI Hipster has already been installed on a machine (e.g. installed on a VM using their provided installation media); and this server will be used to build our custom version of illumos, as well as the custom OI installation media. The goal of this exercise is to create a &ldquo;Live DVD&rdquo; that can be used to install our custom version of illumos.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>About a year ago I had the opportunity to work on a small extension to the OpenZFS zinject command with colleagues Matt Ahrens and Frank Salzmann, during one of our Delphix engineering wide hackathon events. Now that it&rsquo;s in the process of landing in the upstream OpenZFS repository, I wanted to take a minute to show it off.
To describe the new functionality, I&rsquo;ll defer to the help message:</p>

    </h2>
    <p>tl;dr; Cached random read performance of 8K blocks was improved by 225% by reducing internal lock contention within the OpenZFS ARC on illumos.
Introduction Locks are a pain. Even worse, is a single lock serializing all of the page cache accesses for a filesystem. While that&rsquo;s not quite the situation the OpenZFS ARC was in earlier this year, it was pretty close.
For those unfamiliar, the OpenZFS file system is built atop its very own page cache based on the paper by Nimrod Megiddo and Dharmendra S.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>The OpenZFS project is growing! The second annual OpenZFS developer summit concluded just under two months ago, and overall I thought it went very well. There was roughly 70 attendees, twice as many as the previous year, and the talks given were very engaging and interesting.
I gave a short talk about ZFS on the illumos platform, and also touched briefly on some of my subjective opinions coming from a ZFS on Linux background.</p>
