    </h2>
    <p>About a year ago I had the opportunity to work on a small extension to the OpenZFS zinject command with colleagues Matt Ahrens and Frank Salzmann, during one of our Delphix engineering wide hackathon events. Now that it&rsquo;s in the process of landing in the upstream OpenZFS repository, I wanted to take a minute to show it off.
To describe the new functionality, I&rsquo;ll defer to the help message:</p>

    </h2>
    <p>tl;dr; Cached random read performance of 8K blocks was improved by 225% by reducing internal lock contention within the OpenZFS ARC on illumos.
Introduction Locks are a pain. Even worse, is a single lock serializing all of the page cache accesses for a filesystem. While that&rsquo;s not quite the situation the OpenZFS ARC was in earlier this year, it was pretty close.
For those unfamiliar, the OpenZFS file system is built atop its very own page cache based on the paper by Nimrod Megiddo and Dharmendra S.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>The OpenZFS project is growing! The second annual OpenZFS developer summit concluded just under two months ago, and overall I thought it went very well. There was roughly 70 attendees, twice as many as the previous year, and the talks given were very engaging and interesting.
I gave a short talk about ZFS on the illumos platform, and also touched briefly on some of my subjective opinions coming from a ZFS on Linux background.</p>
